## You are presently on Step 1
In Step 1, we will:
1. Update the standard django project to map our own URLs
   * Create `apps.py`
   * Add this as an `INSTALLED_APP` in `settings.py`
   * Add a `views.py` to handle requests
   * Update `urls.py` to point to our `views.py` for default requests

## Go to a previous version
