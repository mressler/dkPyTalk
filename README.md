The Internet of Swings for Code &amp; Supply on March 22nd

## You are presently on Step 2
In Step 2, we will:
1. Start adding some model objects
   * Users and Swings are a good start
   * Be sure to run `python manage.py makemigrations internetOfSwings`
   * Diamond Kinetics' installation does not rely on migrations
   * [This Django reference is great for creating Model objects](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/models/)
2. Add in test data
