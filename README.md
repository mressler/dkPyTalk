## You are presently on Step 4
In Step 4, we will:
1. Start pulling apart CSV sensor data into numpy arrays
   * Check out the swank slicing notation!
2. Visualize this data with matplotlib - *by saving it to a file*!
   * Don't forget about your [backend for matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend)
   * `export MPLBACKEND = Agg` will do the trick
