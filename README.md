# dkPyTalk
The Internet of Swings for Code &amp; Supply on March 22nd

## About this talk
I wanted to do a live coding session to walk everyone through the getting started portions of Django, matplotlib, and numpy, but realized that even in the best scenario I couldn't finish everything in 40 minutes, even with notes in front of me. So I decided to do a hybrid code/talk on top of `git` and `README.md`. To follow along in the talk, the different steps are organized into [branches](https://github.com/mressler/dkPyTalk/branches) that you can checkout and diff between to see the updates.
